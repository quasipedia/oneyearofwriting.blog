As a structured system of communication, writing is also known as written language. Historically, written languages have emerged as a way to record corresponding spoken languages. While the use of language is universal across human societies, most spoken languages are not written. A particular set of symbols, called a script, as well as the rules by which they encode a particular spoken language, is known as a writing system. In some rare cases, writing may be tactile rather than visual.\nThe cognitive and social activity of writing involves neuropsychological and physical processes whose physical output is also called writing (or a text): a series of physically inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented symbols. Reading is the process of looking at writing and accurately comprehending the symbols of a written text.\nIn general, writing systems do not constitute languages in and of themselves, but rather a durable means of representing language such that it can be understood by people at a later time. While not all languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend the capacities of spoken language, transmitting it across space (e.g. written correspondence) and storing it for future reading (e.g. libraries). Writing can also change people\u0026rsquo;s relationships with the knowledge they acquire, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are easier to reflect on, process more slowly, elaborate on, reconsider, and revise.\n","date":"23 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/essays/1766505816560-learning-to-write/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Learning to Write","type":"essays"},{"content":"The two types I see:\nThe singularity The brain rot Singularity # A general superintelligence will take over the world.
