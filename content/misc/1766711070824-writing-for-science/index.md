One of the things that was driving me up the wall, when I first started working in tech was the [mis]use of the wold _experiment_.

{{</lead>}}

Most of the time, the term was used to mean something along the lines of:

> "Let's try Y, and let's see what we can learn from it"

There is nothing wrong with this sentiment, and surely a sharp mind can learn a lot by just venturing into the unknown and keeping their eyes open.

But to a trained scientist, the use of the word _experiment_ to designate this kind of trials is anathema. The "let's try something" is an attitude better suited for alchemy than science. In science, an experiment is the deliberate testing of an hypothesis using the scientific method. In layman terms it's roughly equivalent to:

> "I believe that this is how X works. Therefore *if* I do Y, *then* I should observe Z"

Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with doing what we could call _alchemical trials_ (or their modern equivalent). This is a completely legit way to explore reality around us, and a strong enabler of serendipitous discoveries.

But _alchemical trials_ rarely contribute to the _understanding_ of reality: they are at most an inefficient way to build a corpus of popular knowledge, technologies without the science to back it up. Through alchemy, you serendipitously learn how to perform certain operations, like producing pottery or treating certain illness with plants, without any understanding of the chemistry behind it (in fact, ignoring completely the existence of chemistry in the first place). Furthermore, history is full of example of flawed understanding having dramatic consequences)[^1].

On the other hand, science is laborious and fatiguing. Through science one climbs the ladder of progress at much greater speed, each discovery and conceptualisation enabling humankind to push the boundaries of our understanding further and further. But thinking and running experiments is hard, understanding what are the relevant parts of a system and isolating them almost a form of art.

## The Alchemical Bit

- New thoughts. Through researching for a piece, feedback by reader, firing of adjacent neurons

- New people.

## The scientific Bit

- A method to iterate over the text. I get too early to the editing part.

- Overall time spent writing.

- A domain-specific knowledge (AI safety)
