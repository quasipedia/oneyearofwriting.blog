When discussing about learning, I sometimes refer to two archetypes that I came up with: the _explorer_ and the _scientist_.

{{</lead>}}

In this post I am going to explain this model, not really because it's groundbreaking cognitive science, but because I refer to it often enough in my thinking that I believe it will be useful for me to have a place to refer to it in later posts.

In my mental model, the _explorer_ is the archetype who learns new things by simply plunging into the unknown.

> _"If you’re exploring the unknown, by definition, you don’t know where you’re going."_

I will take the example of Marco Polo as prototypical explorer.

Polo (an Italian merchant who lived in the XIII century) followed the silk road from his native Venice throughout Asia, crossing the entire continent and reaching the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. He spent the best part of 25 years on a single journey and his experience and discoveries are recounted in the book "Il Milione"[^0].

However, the things he discovered where so novel that neither his contemporaries in Venice, nor Polo himself fully understood their significance. Among others, Polo (who lived in the XIII century), recounted of _paper money_ (Europe will see the first banknote only four centuries later), _coal used as fuel_ (Europe: one centuries later), _eyeglasses_ (two centuries), _gunpowder for military applications_ (one century), _postal services_ (two centuries). In fact Marco Polo was systematically accused to have embellished or straight-out invented his stories and legend has it that on his dying bed his last words were: _"I did not write half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed"_.

Like Marco Polo, the learner who uses the explorer archetype ventures into the unknown and - by definition - doesn't know where they are going. Consequently, _resourcefulness_ is a key asset for this kind of learning and the learner-explorer is bound to do many serendipitous discoveries, sometimes being unable to fully appreciate their depth or implications.

Out of the metaphor, examples of learning as an *explorer* could be things like:

- buying a kayak and just figuring out how to paddle on your own,

- partaking in a bootcamp for coding without having ever programmed in your life,

- leaving for a hitch-hiking trip in a country you never visited before

By contrast, the _scientist_ is the archetype who seeks new knowledge by validating their hypothesis through rigorous testing. Rather than venturing in the dept of the unknown, they methodically probe just beyond the boundary of what is already been thoroughly mapped.

> _"if you do not know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else"_

I will take the example of Marie Curie as prototypical scientist.

Curie (born Skłodowska) was a Polish-born French scientist. She was the first woman to win a Nobel prize. In fact she is among the handful of people who won it twice and - as 2026 - she remains the only person tho have won it in two different scientific fields.

Curie discoveries built upon each other: intrigued by Uranium, she wanted to see if other elements shared the same characteristics, and in doing so she discovered Polonium and shortly after Radium, thus winning the Nobel prize for the discovery of radioactivity (1903). Radium is though a very difficult element to work with, and her work on the process to isolate it, the study of its compounds, as well as its use in medicine made her win the Nobel prize in Chemistry (1911). A few years later Curie used her knowledge of radioactivity and radioactive materials to pioneer medical radiography, and during WWI she built, drove and operated mobile radiological units at the front. 

Like Marie Curie, the learner who uses the scientist archetype is extremely deliberate about the direction they follow. Their strengths is _intentionality_, and through it they will often do discoveries that confirm their hypothesis and contribute to an ever deeper understanding of the topic at hand.

Out of the metaphor, examples of learning as a *scientist* could be things like:

- learning to swim crawl if you already master backstroke,

- deep diving into wood turning after your learnt cabinet-making,

- reading an anthropological study of different culture,

At this point I feel that I should come clean and admit it: despite having trained as a scientist at university, I'm a hopeless explorer at heart. I'm the kind of person who likes new adventures and has often turned upside-down their life on a hunch or intuition.

This is why I started "One Year of Writing". It was the appeal of an adventure, the lure of "going where I have never gone before" that made me start.

The Marco Polo within me expects that by writing regularly - among others - I will gain come across...

- New thoughts from researching. For me writing is a way to gel intuitions into mental models. In order to do so, I tend to do quite some research, and in doing so I refine and change my models. For example: for a lot of years I used the model I presented in this very post under the dichotomy "alchemist vs. scientist". I always found evocative to contrast what I imagined to be a "let's try to mix these two things together randomly" to proper science. But in writing this piece, and researching alchemy as a topic, I realised that I had a very stereotypical, and incomplete view of alchemy, and - above all - I completely missed the philosophical and mystical dimensions of it.

- New thoughts from readers' feedback. The other expected source of new thoughts - if this blog will ever get some traction - is readers. Looking at my own experience as a commentator to other people's posts, I know that the interaction readership/author can generate a lot of interesting discussions, so I'm hoping this will happen in my case.

- New thoughts from reverse associative thinking (RAT)[^1]. Normally _associative thinking_ is the way in which the brain associate new information with familiar one, triggering memories and emotions. RAT is based on the very same connection (old and new information) but in reverse: instead of "pulling" memories and emotions from something known, you "push" new frames of references and emotions onto it. For example, building on the example above about alchemy: realising that alchemy

- New interesting people. On LinkedIn it has happened more than once that interesting people reached out to me after they read something I wrote. I even met IRL some of the people who did, and it has been an incredible experience of discovery and widening my own horizon.

For all of the love that I have for Marco Polo, it is my conviction that both archetypes are equally good. I also observed that most people tend to have a favourite archetype, and this somehow blinds them to the opportunities that present themselves to the other archetype.

My working hypothesis is that a deliberate effort to embrace both ways of learning, yields better knowledge (= a deeper understanding), and in this vein I spent some time interrogating myself on what the version of Marie Curie who inhabits my brain would try to get out of _One Year of Writing_. Here's my best bet:

- A method to compose text iteratively. If I observe how I write, I can see that I do massive amount of premature optimisation[^2] and it takes forever for me to get to a reasonable draft. Instead I would like my writing to resemble product development: get to a first prototype (a first draft) nearly immediately, and use it to check if the reasoning flows and the arguments are solid, and only then move over to an iterative process of refinement (conciseness, figures of speech, clarity, ect...). Where I think the intentionality of the scientist will help me is to come up with a proper method, with rules, techniques and checkpoints. Iterative writing doesn't come naturally to me, so discipline is probably the only thing that will help me improving.

- Speed. If the issue with premature optimisation wasn't slowing me down enough, the reality is that I am a very slow writer on my own account. At times I block in front of a new empty line. Other times I spend 5 minutes just trying to pin down what I _really_ want to say. And I often lose focus, losing myself in my own thoughts. I'm not saying that I want to radically change who I am, but I definitively want to at least have the _option_ to jot down a post faster. Again, I think that a method/discipline here may help.

- Domain-specific knowledge. I am a man of many interests but for _One Year of Writing_, I elected to focus primarily only on two themes: _leadership_ and _technology_. I expect the first to be mostly dedicated to formalise my own set of mental models around leadership, and the second to _AI safety_. My hypothesis is that - with a bit of support from Madame Curie - I will be able to turn experiences and ideas into a cohesive lattice of mental models (i.e.: knowledge) on both accounts.

- Perseverance & Discipline. To persevere in the face of failure and be disciplined despite distractions is always going to require effort, but I hope this blog will be sort of a "mental gym" to make less expensive (in terms of willpower) to activate that "discipline muscle". Like a scientist - I plan to do this by observing and reflecting on my mental patterns, and to be able to identify effective and "cheap" counter-measures for when I will feel demotivated. Like for the training one does at the gym, I hope this will have a positive effect on my capacity do be _efficiently_ disciplined also in the word out there.

[^0]: For historical reasons the book is known under many different titles, "Il Milione" (the Million), "Livre des Merveilles du Monde" (the book of the marvels of the World), "Devisement du Monde" (description of the World), "The travels of Marco Polo", and a few others. I chose to use "Il Milione" because - as legend has it - the name of the book comes from the attitude of his contemporaries, who believed the book contained "a million lies and exaggerations".

[^1]: For as scientific as it may sound, this is a completely made-up term.

[^2]: I shall emphasise the _premature_ part here, meaning that it's not simply _early_ in the process, but _too early_, thus leading to a lot of waste, as I will very often remove entire sections of my text that I had already "optimised".
