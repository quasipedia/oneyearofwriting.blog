## Mental Model

{{<lead>}}

When discussing about learning, I sometimes refer to two archetypes that I came up with: the _explorer_ and the _scientist_.

{{</lead>}}

In my mental model, the _explorer_ is the archetype who learns new things by simply plunging into the unknown. Resourcefulness and resilience are their strengths.

However, as the saying goes...

> "if you're exploring the unknown, by definition, you don't know where you're going."

...and for this reason the explorer will often do serendipitous discoveries without fully appreciating their depth or implications.

By contrast, the _scientist_ is the archetype who seeks new knowledge by validating their hypothesis through rigorous testing. Rather than venturing in the dept of the unknown: they methodically probe just beyond the boundary of what is already been thoroughly mapped. They believe that...

> "if you do not know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else"

...and for this reason they are extremely deliberate about the direction they follow. Their strengths are intentionality and perseverance, and through them they will often do discoveries that are counter-intuitive and profound.

It is my conviction that both archetypes are equally good, and that - to an extent - they coexist in every person. However I also observed that most people tend to have a favourite archetype, and this somehow blinds them to the opportunities that present themselves to the other archetype.

My working hypothesis is that a deliberate effort to embrace both ways of learning, yields better knowledge (= a deeper understanding).

## Application

So, in an effort to "walk the talk", here is how I think of my two archetypes in relation to the "One Year of Writing" project. 

I am old enough to know that I am much more of a Marco Polo than a Marie Curie. Once my caravan will leave Venice for the far East, I expect to:

- New thoughts. Through researching for a piece, feedback by reader, firing of adjacent neurons

- New people.

- A method to iterate over the text. I get too early to the editing part.

- Overall time spent writing.

- A domain-specific knowledge (AI safety)

- Perseverance / Discipline
