Have you ever heard about the Harvard Business School study that shows how writing down your goals makes you 10 times more likely to achieve them?

{{</lead>}}

Well... It turns that's a urban legend, and that such study doesn't exist.

Or to be more precise: it didn't exist until 2007 (decades after the original legend popped into existence) when Dr. Gail Matthews of the Dominican University of California felt compelled to "posthumously" do [the study](https://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=psychology-faculty-conference-presentations) everybody thought it already existed.

## The Theory

The short version of its conclusion is that writing down your goals does indeed increases your chances to reaching them by 50%, which even if it is a harsh downgrade relative to the myth (it is 20 times less than the original claim) it is still a very sizeable difference.

However, the the study went beyond testing written vs. unwritten goals, and showed that the group that wrote their goals AND made a commitment to specific actions AND picked a supportive friend as an "accountability partner" AND sent weekly progress reports to them had a whopping 78% more chances to actually achieve their goals relative to those who did nothing at all (18% more than those only writing down their goals).

In more general terms, the study found that success in goal achievement correlates well with *written goals*, *public commitment* and *accountability*.



So, long story short, this post is me walking the talk and doing all those three things.



## Written Goals

To understand how I structured my goals, it may be useful to read my previous post about explorers and scientists. If you are in a pinch the TL;DR version is: its good to mix organic learning (explorers) with deliberate research (sientists).



{{< article link="/misc/of-explorers-and-scientists/" showSummary=true compactSummary=true >}}



Despite having trained as a scientist at university, I'm a hopeless explorer at heart. I'm the kind of person who likes new adventures and has often turned upside-down their life on a hunch or intuition.

This is why I started "One Year of Writing". It was the appeal of an adventure, the lure of "going where I have never gone before" that made me start.

The Marco Polo within me expects that by writing regularly - among others - I will gain come across...

- New thoughts from researching. For me writing is a way to gel intuitions into mental models. In order to do so, I tend to do quite some research, and in doing so I refine and change my models. For example: for a lot of years I used the model I presented in this very post under the dichotomy "alchemist vs. scientist". I always found evocative to contrast what I imagined to be a "let's try to mix these two things together randomly" to proper science. But in writing this piece, and researching alchemy as a topic, I realised that I had a very stereotypical, and incomplete view of alchemy, and - above all - I completely missed the philosophical and mystical dimensions of it.

- New thoughts from readers' feedback. The other expected source of new thoughts - if this blog will ever get some traction - is readers. Looking at my own experience as a commentator to other people's posts, I know that the interaction readership/author can generate a lot of interesting discussions, so I'm hoping this will happen in my case.

- New thoughts from reverse associative thinking (RAT)[^1]. Normally _associative thinking_ is the way in which the brain associate new information with familiar one, triggering memories and emotions. RAT is based on the very same connection (old and new information) but in reverse: instead of "pulling" memories and emotions from something known, you "push" new frames of references and emotions onto it. For example, building on the example above about alchemy: realising that alchemy

- New interesting people. On LinkedIn it has happened more than once that interesting people reached out to me after they read something I wrote. I even met IRL some of the people who did, and it has been an incredible experience of discovery and widening my own horizon.

For all of the love that I have for Marco Polo, it is my conviction that both archetypes are equally good. I also observed that most people tend to have a favourite archetype, and this somehow blinds them to the opportunities that present themselves to the other archetype.

My working hypothesis is that a deliberate effort to embrace both ways of learning, yields better knowledge (= a deeper understanding), and in this vein I spent some time interrogating myself on what the version of Marie Curie who inhabits my brain would try to get out of _One Year of Writing_. Here's my best bet:

- A method to compose text iteratively. If I observe how I write, I can see that I do massive amount of premature optimisation[^2] and it takes forever for me to get to a reasonable draft. Instead I would like my writing to resemble product development: get to a first prototype (a first draft) nearly immediately, and use it to check if the reasoning flows and the arguments are solid, and only then move over to an iterative process of refinement (conciseness, figures of speech, clarity, ect...). Where I think the intentionality of the scientist will help me is to come up with a proper method, with rules, techniques and checkpoints. Iterative writing doesn't come naturally to me, so discipline is probably the only thing that will help me improving.

- Speed. If the issue with premature optimisation wasn't slowing me down enough, the reality is that I am a very slow writer on my own account. At times I block in front of a new empty line. Other times I spend 5 minutes just trying to pin down what I _really_ want to say. And I often lose focus, losing myself in my own thoughts. I'm not saying that I want to radically change who I am, but I definitively want to at least have the _option_ to jot down a post faster. Again, I think that a method/discipline here may help.

- Domain-specific knowledge. I am a man of many interests but for _One Year of Writing_, I elected to focus primarily only on two themes: _leadership_ and _technology_. I expect the first to be mostly dedicated to formalise my own set of mental models around leadership, and the second to _AI safety_. My hypothesis is that - with a bit of support from Madame Curie - I will be able to turn experiences and ideas into a cohesive lattice of mental models (i.e.: knowledge) on both accounts.

- Perseverance & Discipline. To persevere in the face of failure and be disciplined despite distractions is always going to require effort, but I hope this blog will be sort of a "mental gym" to make less expensive (in terms of willpower) to activate that "discipline muscle". Like a scientist - I plan to do this by observing and reflecting on my mental patterns, and to be able to identify effective and "cheap" counter-measures for when I will feel demotivated. Like for the training one does at the gym, I hope this will have a positive effect on my capacity do be _efficiently_ disciplined also in the word out there.

[^1]: For as scientific as it may sound, this is a completely made-up term.

[^2]: I shall emphasise the _premature_ part here, meaning that it's not simply _early_ in the process, but _too early_, thus leading to a lot of waste, as I will very often remove entire sections of my text that I had already "optimised".
