Years ago, I came up with the idea of two archetypes of learner: the _explorer_ and the _scientist_. In this post I am going to explain this model, not really because it's groundbreaking cognitive science, but because I refer to it often enough in my writing that I believe it will be useful for me to have an explanation of it to link back to in later posts.

## The Explorer

In my mental model, the _explorer_ is the archetype who learns new things by simply plunging into the unknown.

> _"If you’re exploring the unknown, by definition, you don’t know where you’re going."_

I will take the example of Marco Polo as prototypical explorer.

Polo (an Italian merchant who lived in the XIII century) followed the silk road from his native Venice throughout Asia, crossing the entire continent and reaching the coast of the Pacific Ocean close to Japan. He spent the best part of 25 years on his journey and his experience and discoveries are recounted in the book "Il Milione"[^0].

However, the things he discovered where so novel that neither his contemporaries in Venice, nor Polo himself fully understood their significance. Among others, Polo (who lived in the XIII century), recounted of _paper money_ (Europe will see the first banknote only four centuries later, in Sweden), _coal used as fuel_ (Britain will start using it only one century later), _eyeglasses_ (two centuries), _gunpowder for military applications_ (one century), _postal services_ (two centuries). In fact Marco Polo was systematically accused of having embellished or straight-out invented his stories throughout his life, and legend has it that on his dying bed his last words were: _"I did not write half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed"_.

Like Marco Polo, the learner who uses the explorer archetype ventures into the unknown and - by definition - doesn't know where they are going. Consequently, _resourcefulness_ is a key asset for this kind of learning and the learner-explorer is bound to do many serendipitous discoveries, sometimes being unable to fully appreciate their depth or implications, due to a lack of context.

Out of the metaphor, examples of learning as an _explorer_ could be things like:

- buying a kayak and just figuring out how to paddle on your own,

- partaking in a boot-camp for coding without having ever programmed in your life,

- leaving for a hitch-hiking trip in a country you never visited before.

## The Scientist

By contrast, the _scientist_ is the archetype who seeks new knowledge by validating their hypothesis through rigorous testing.

Rather than venturing in the dept of the unknown, they methodically probe just beyond the boundary of what is already been thoroughly mapped.

> _"if you do not know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else"_

I will take the example of Marie Curie as prototypical scientist.

Curie was a Polish-born French scientist. She was the first woman to win a Nobel prize. In fact she is among the handful of people who won it twice and - as 2026 - she remains the only person who won it in two different scientific fields.

Curie discoveries built upon each other: intrigued by Uranium, she wanted to see if other elements shared the same characteristics, and in doing so she discovered Polonium and shortly after Radium, thus winning the Nobel prize for the discovery of radioactivity (1903). However, Radium is a very difficult element to work with, and her work on the method to isolate it and the study of its compounds were exceptional enough to make her win the Nobel prize in Chemistry (1911). A few years later Curie used her knowledge of radioactivity and radioactive materials to pioneer medical radiography, going as far as building and operating mobile units on the front of WWI.

Like Marie Curie, the learner who uses the scientist archetype is extremely deliberate about the direction they follow. Their strengths is _intentionality_, and through it they will often do incremental discoveries that contribute to a deeper understanding of the topic they are focusing on.

Out of the metaphor, examples of learning as a _scientist_ could be things like:

- learning to swim crawl if you already master backstroke,

- deep diving into wood turning after your learnt traditional wook working,

- reading an anthropological study of a different culture.

## Two to Tango

What I observed in my years as educator, is that people tend to have a favourite archetype, and they rarely switch to the other one on their own accord.

However, my working hypothesis is that a deliberate effort to embrace *both* ways of learning, yields better results. That is: the combination of an explorer's serendipitous discovery with the depth of a scientist's understanding of it, yields a more *complete knowledge* and a *deeper understanding*.

In particular, I am *not* advocating for an approach that some could call "balanced": I find that there is very little to gain from an explorer who won't go further than their backyard, or a scientist who'll only play with a junior chemistry set.

What I am advocating for, is developing the capacity to efficiently toggle what archetype is being used and becoming able to go from passionate exploration to methodical lab work at a moment's notice (and the other way around). In fact one could see this model as the opposite of _balanced_: the middle point between the two archetypes is not the local *minima* (the place where the system will balance itself) but the local *maxima*, that is: the point for crossing which the system will require additional energy.

As I said above: my observation is that people rarely switch archetype on their own accord, and I am not an exception to this general rule. So: here are a couple of the techniques I use to snap out of my favourite learning archetype:

- **Writing about what I am learning**. By doing so, it often becomes apparent where the weakest link of my mental model is, whether that is missing an entire perspective on the problem (requiring more exploration) or a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that govern it (requiring more science).

- **Being aware of the mindset I am adopting**. As I mentioned above, *resourcefulness* and _intentionality_ are the hallmark of the two archetypes. Thus, by recognising them in action, I can understand which archetype I am using. For example: if I'm coding and find myself trying to solve the same problem by trying out 5 different half-baked approaches (resourcefullness) I know I am in exploration mode, while if I'm reading through the API documentation, and watching a tutorial on how to do something (intentionality), I know I am in science mode.

- **Prompting myself with questions**. Once I know which archetype I need to use, I try to awaken it by prompting myself with questions that are targeted to either of the two specifically. For example to awaken the explorer I may ask myself: "What is something radically different that I haven't tried before?" or "How would a person with a completely different background look at this very problem?". While if I wanted to awaken the scientist I may ask myself: "How can I validate this assumption of mines?" or "How can I measure the effects of X on Y?".

This is the end of this post[^1].





[^0]: For historical reasons the book is known under many different titles, including "Livre des Merveilles du Monde" (the book of the marvels of the World), "Devisement du Monde" (description of the World), "The travels of Marco Polo", and a few others. I chose to use "Il Milione" because - as legend has it - the name of the book comes from the attitude of his contemporaries, who believed the book contained "a million lies and exaggerations".

[^1]: Yes I know, it is an abrupt way to close a post and I realise that this would have been the perfect spot to ask something along the lines of "What is your favourite archetype?" or "What is your favourite technique to switch between archetypes?" followed by a "Let me know in the comments below!". But since I don't like those questions as a reader (In most cases I find them an insincere and formulaic way to elicit engagement for the sake of the algorithms, rather than genuine curiosity), I actively resist them as a writer. Plus: at the time of writing - this blog doesn't have the possibility to comment yet. If you are still burning to give me feedback, drop me an email or a DM on LinkedIn and I will read it with genuine interest.
