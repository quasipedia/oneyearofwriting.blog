When discussing about learning, I sometimes refer to two archetypes that I came up with: the _explorer_ and the _scientist_.

{{</lead>}}

In this post I am going to explain this model, not really because it's groundbreaking cognitive science, but because I refer to it often enough in my thinking that I believe it will be useful for me to have a place to refer to it in later posts.

In my mental model, the _explorer_ is the archetype who learns new things by simply plunging into the unknown.

> _"If you’re exploring the unknown, by definition, you don’t know where you’re going."_

I will take the example of Marco Polo as prototypical explorer.

Polo (an Italian merchant who lived in the XIII century) followed the silk road from his native Venice throughout Asia, crossing the entire continent and reaching the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. He spent the best part of 25 years on a single journey and his experience and discoveries are recounted in the book "Il Milione"[^0].

However, the things he discovered where so novel that neither his contemporaries in Venice, nor Polo himself fully understood their significance. Among others, Polo (who lived in the XIII century), recounted of _paper money_ (Europe will see the first banknote only four centuries later), _coal used as fuel_ (Europe: one centuries later), _eyeglasses_ (two centuries), _gunpowder for military applications_ (one century), _postal services_ (two centuries). In fact Marco Polo was systematically accused to have embellished or straight-out invented his stories and legend has it that on his dying bed his last words were: _"I did not write half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed"_.

Like Marco Polo, the learner who uses the explorer archetype ventures into the unknown and - by definition - doesn't know where they are going. Consequently, _resourcefulness_ is a key asset for this kind of learning and the learner-explorer is bound to do many serendipitous discoveries, sometimes being unable to fully appreciate their depth or implications.

Out of the metaphor, examples of learning as an _explorer_ could be things like:

- buying a kayak and just figuring out how to paddle on your own,

- partaking in a bootcamp for coding without having ever programmed in your life,

- leaving for a hitch-hiking trip in a country you never visited before

By contrast, the _scientist_ is the archetype who seeks new knowledge by validating their hypothesis through rigorous testing. Rather than venturing in the dept of the unknown, they methodically probe just beyond the boundary of what is already been thoroughly mapped.

I will take the example of Marie Curie as prototypical scientist.

Curie (born Skłodowska) was a Polish-born French scientist. She was the first woman to win a Nobel prize. In fact she is among the handful of people who won it twice and - as 2026 - she remains the only person tho have won it in two different scientific fields.

Curie discoveries built upon each other: intrigued by Uranium, she wanted to see if other elements shared the same characteristics, and in doing so she discovered Polonium and shortly after Radium, thus winning the Nobel prize for the discovery of radioactivity (1903). Radium is though a very difficult element to work with, and her work on the process to isolate it, the study of its compounds, as well as its use in medicine made her win the Nobel prize in Chemistry (1911). A few years later Curie used her knowledge of radioactivity and radioactive materials to pioneer medical radiography, and during WWI she built, drove and operated mobile radiological units at the front.

Like Marie Curie, the learner who uses the scientist archetype is extremely deliberate about the direction they follow. Their strengths is _intentionality_, and through it they will often do discoveries that confirm their hypothesis and contribute to an ever deeper understanding of the topic at hand.

Out of the metaphor, examples of learning as a _scientist_ could be things like:

- learning to swim crawl if you already master backstroke,

- deep diving into wood turning after your learnt cabinet-making,

- reading an anthropological study of different culture,

[^0]: For historical reasons the book is known under many different titles, including "Livre des Merveilles du Monde" (the book of the marvels of the World), "Devisement du Monde" (description of the World), "The travels of Marco Polo", and a few others. I chose to use "Il Milione" because - as legend has it - the name of the book comes from the attitude of his contemporaries, who believed the book contained "a million lies and exaggerations".
