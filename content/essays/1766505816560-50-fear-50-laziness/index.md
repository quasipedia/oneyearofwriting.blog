Throughout my life, I have come across people who appreciated my writing  skills and encouraged me to develop them.

Twice during my student years I have been accused of having copied my essays from somewhere because my writing seemed too advanced for my age and experience; and for as long as I can remember as an adult, friends and colleagues have encouraged me to dedicate time to writing for an audience.

But I never did.

It's not that I think I missed out on the opportunity to become an international best-selling author swaying the hearts and minds of millions of readers.

In fact I don't have regrets about not having invested on writing.  For one, I have a life full of things that may not have brought me fame and glory, but that I consider more meaningful accomplishments. Secondly, the people who thought I had a lot of potential may just have been plainly mistaken.

And yet.

Regrets or not, it is a fact that despite the much encouragement and the occasional young adult's fantasy about the masses of faithful readers I would have gartered with my writing, I never invested time in honing the skill. And now that I am not a young adult any more, I became curious about _why_ I chose not to do that.

I expected that pondering on this question would have been a long and meandering quest of self-awareness and exploration, my thoughts relentlessly pouring out in a stream of consciousness...

...but the reality is that it took me a whole three minutes of thinking, to find out what the answer was.

I have been lazy. And I have been afraid.

I hate to admit it. But there is really nothing deeper to it than that. My 40-something self would have absolutely loved being interviewed on TV about his latest book, but my 20- and 30-something self had absolutely zero intention to make any effort or dedicate any time to do the job to get there. And perhaps more importantly: my 20-something loved the _idea_ of being a very talented author, but was positively terrified by the perspective of finding out that - _in reality_ - they were a mediocre scribbler at best.

I am now 50-something. I still don't have plans to devote myself to becoming an accomplished writer, but I grew a bit wiser. Wise enough to know that where there is fear, often lies a lot of interesting learning and personal growth, and that talent without practice is like power without control.

So - long story short - I decided to set up this experiment that I called "One Year of Writing", and which TL;DR version is: "I committed to write every week of 2026. For science, rather than readership."

More on this project in a future post. But this very first one wouldn't feel complete if I didn't at least give a shutout to [Alex](https://www.alexewerlof.com/), a former colleague of mines and present friend and writer, who for the past 4 years relentlessly encouraged me to pick the metaphorical pen up.

Without his constant, friendly and encouraging nagging you wouldn't be reading this.
