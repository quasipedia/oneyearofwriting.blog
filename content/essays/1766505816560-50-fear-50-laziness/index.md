Over the years, I have met a surprising number of people who have praised my writing and encouraged me to develop it further.

{{</lead>}}

Twice during my student years, teachers accused me of copying my essays, claiming my writing was too advanced for my age and experience. And even as an adult, friends and colleagues have often urged me to write for an audience.

But I never did.

By any means: I don't regret not having invested more time writing. My life has been filled with experiences that I consider equally if not more meaningful than the fame and glory reserved for best-selling authors (and there is no telling if I would have achieved that status in the first place).

But notwithstanding the lack of regrets, now that I’m no longer a young adult in their prime, I have started to wonder: why didn’t I take that leap?

I thought answering this question would have been a long and meandering journey of self-discovery, with my thoughts spilling out in a stream of consciousness... But in reality, it only took me three minutes to figure out the answer.

I have been lazy. And I have been afraid.

I hate to admit it, but there’s no deeper truth than this rather unoriginal observation on laziness and fear having the best of me. My 40-something self would have loved to be interviewed on TV about his latest book, but my 20- and 30-something selves had absolutely zero intention of putting in the effort to get there. And more importantly, my younger self loved the idea of being a talented author, but was terrified of discovering I was just a mediocre scribbler.

Now, at 50-something, I still don’t plan on devoting myself to becoming a published author. But I have learned a few things along the way. For example I have realised that fear often holds the potential for growth, and that talent without practice is like power without control.

So, long story short: I decided to launch an experiment I’m calling “One Year of Writing.” The short version: I’m committing to write every week of 2026. Not for fame. Not for glory. But for personal growth and scientific curiosity.

More on this project in future posts. But this first one wouldn’t feel complete without giving a shout-out to [Alex](https://www.alexewerlof.com/), a former colleague, current friend and writer, who’s spent the past four years relentlessly encouraging me to pick up the metaphorical pen.
