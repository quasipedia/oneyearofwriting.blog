Since I was a young kid, I have come across people who appreciated my writing  skills and encouraged me to develop them.

Twice (when I was 10 and then again when I was 17) I have been accused of having copied my essays from "somewhere" because my writing seemed too advanced for my age; and even throughout my adult life friends and colleagues have regularly encouraged me to dedicate time to writing for an audience.

I'm not suggesting that I could have been an international best-selling author swaying the hearts and minds of thousands (_hundreds of thousands_!), and instead I spent half of my life meaninglessly withering away doing nothing of value.

In fact I don't have regrets about not having invested on writing.  For one, I have a life full of things that may not have brought me fame, but that I consider more meaningful accomplishments. Secondly, the people who thought I had a lot of potential may just have been plainly mistaken.

And yet.

Regrets or not, it is a fact that despite the much encouragement and the occasional young adult's fantasy about the hundreds of thousands (_millions_!) of faithful readers, I never invested time in honing the skill. And now that I am not a young adult any more, I became curious on _why_ I never did.

I expected pondering on this question would have been an interesting and meandering quest of self-awareness and exploration, the archetypal figures of the great authors of the past looming over my hunched back, with me toiling away at the wee hours of the night, my thoughts relentlessly pouring out on a leather-bound hand-crafted notebook...

...but the reality is that it took a whole 3 minutes of thinking, for the answer I was looking for to become clear.

I have been lazy. And I have been afraid.

I hate to admit it, but there is really nothing deeper to it than that. My 40-something self would have absolutely loved being interviewed on TV about his latest book, but my 20- and 30-something self had absolutely zero intention to make any effort or dedicate any time to do the job to get there. And perhaps more importantly: my 20-something loved the _idea_ of being very talented so much, than he had zero willingness to find out if that potential was _factually_ there.

I am now 50-something. I still don't have plans to write a book for my _dozens of millions_ of readers, but I grew a bit wiser. Wise enough to know that where there is fear often lies a lot of learning and growth, and that talent without practice is like power without control.

So - long story short - I set up this experiment that I called "One Year of Writing", the TL;DR version of which being: "I commit to write every week of 2026. For science." (and for my first _billion_ readers, of course).

More on this project in a future post. But this one wouldn't feel complete if I didn't at least give a shutout to [Alex](https://www.alexewerlof.com/), a former colleague, friend and writer who for the past 3 years relentlessly encouraged me to pick the metaphorical pen up.

Without his constant and encouraging nagging you wouldn't be reading this.
